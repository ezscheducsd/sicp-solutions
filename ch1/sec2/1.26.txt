Exercise 1.26: Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty do-
ing Exercise 1.24. His fast-prime? test seems to run more
slowly than his prime? test. Louis calls his friend Eva Lu
Ator over to help. When they examine Louis’s code, they
find that he has rewrien the expmod procedure to use an
explicit multiplication, rather than calling square :
(define (expmod base exp m)
(cond ((= exp 0) 1)
((even? exp)
(remainder (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
(expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
m))
(else
(remainder (* base
(expmod base (- exp 1) m))
m))))

Here, we can see that (expmod base (/ exp 2))
will be evaluated twice in each call to expmod.
This holds the same for all subsequent recursive calls.

So the total number of nodes in the tree will be:
1 + 2 +
