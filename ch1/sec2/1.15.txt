sine of angle 
sin x ~= x if x is sufficiently small.

sin x = 3sin(x/3) - 4sin^3(x/3)

What is the order of growth in space and number of
steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated
by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

Order of growth in space is the maximum depth
of the recursive tree.
The bottom is reached when x is sufficiently small,
and we get there by continually dividing
x by 3.
So this procedure is log_3(a) in space.
