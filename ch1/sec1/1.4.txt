Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows
for combinations whose operators are compound expres-
sions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the
following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
    ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

The if expression will evaluate to the machine instructions of 
the + procedure if b is greater than 0.
In this case, a-plus-abs-b applied to a and b will evaluate to 
the value of a + b. This makes sense because the absolute value of a positive number
is simply itself.


The if expression will evalute to the machine instructions of the -
procedure if b is less than or equal to 0.
In this case, a-plus-abs-b applied to a and b will evaluate to the
value of a - (-b). This makes sense because the absolute value of a non positive
number is its opposite. 
So if b is non positive, a + abs(b) is equivalent to a + (- b) = a - b, 
so the procedure is also correct in this case.
